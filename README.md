# Employee Management System (MERN)

This project is a **CRUD application** that manages employee details. Built as a part of **Future Intern Task 2**, it utilizes the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to handle backend and frontend operations seamlessly.  

## Features

- **Create**: Add new employees with details like name, email, position, and salary.  
- **Read**: View the list of all employees with their complete details.  
- **Update**: Edit existing employee details.  
- **Delete**: Remove an employee from the database.
